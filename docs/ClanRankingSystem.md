# Clan Ranking System  
As set forth in the Bylaws, the Clan shall establish a system through which Members may earn rank by applying point values to various activities.  
# How it Works  
Members may gain points by completing activities that are deemed to contribute value for the clan. In-game ranks shall be gained and lost by crossing various point thresholds. Some activities may be tracked automatically, whereas others must be logged by the Staff.  
# Points  
Points are used as a measure of cumulative activity, loyalty, and contribution to the clan. Points may be gained by completing any of the eligible activities as defined below. Loss of points shall only occur in the following instances:  
* When correcting a mistake in reporting.  
* When adjusting point values to match rank thresholds following a change in the Ranking System and a grace period of no less than thirty (30) days.  

The High Council may award additional points for unlisted reasons at their discretion with a simple majority approval from the remainder of the High Council.  
## Changes to Activity Values  
Point values may increase temporarily for special events or activities. Temporary value increases may be done as a set value of bonus points or as a multiplier to the original activity's base point value. Any stipulations to these temporary increases must be disclosed at the time of announcement of the temporary value increase.  
Values for activities may only be decreased with majority approval from a vote of the High Council following a voting time of no less than one (1) week. Decreases shall be given a minimum of one (1) week's notice prior to taking effect.  
Unless specifically noted otherwise, changes to point values will not be retroactive. (I.E. point value changes will not affect activities for which points have already been rewarded.)  
# Eligible Activities  
## Recruiting  
* **Points:** 200  
* **Description:** Recruiting a new member into the clan. The new member must remain in the clan for (at the Staff's discretion) a reasonable amount of time, else the points may be deemed invalid.

## Visiting the Clan Citadel  
* **Points:** 50  
* **Description:** Contributing to the visitor count at the Clan Citadel in a given week.

An additional amount of bonus points may be applied during Capping Events with the value determined in the event announcement.  
* **Tracking Method:** Caps are tracked automatically. Members must have their Adventure Log publicly visible  to be tracked. Capping Event bonus points are tracked as a normal event.  
## Event Participation (Official Events)  
* **Points:** 50 - 150  
* **Description:** Participating in events that have been scheduled and hosted by the Staff. Qualification may depend on time spent at the event. The amount of points awarded for attending an event shall be disclosed prior to the start of the event.

* **Tracking Method:** Event host shall count participants based on the event's criteria and award points upon event conclusion. If the event host is not a member of the Staff, participant list shall be given to a member of the Staff to ensure points are awarded.  
## Event Hosting (All)  
* **Points:** `[event points] + (([event points]/10) * participants)`  
* **Description:** Points for hosting an event. Amount of points awarded is determined by the above formula. Points awarded to the host should be equal to the participation amount (regardless of participation by the host) with an additional bonus of one-tenth that amount per participant.  
* **Tracking Method:** Staff shall calculate and apply the host points upon event conclusion.  
# Ranks  
The in-game clan ranks are primarily split into two tiers--members and staff--with General being the highest member rank and Administrator being the lowest staff rank. Movement between tiers have additional requirements on top of the point value.  
## Gaining Rank  
Upon fulfilling the requirements for their next rank, members will be marked eligible for promotion during the next rank check.  
Rank checks shall occur on the first Wednesday of each month, during which all members eligible for promotion shall be moved exactly one rank higher in the hierarchy.
